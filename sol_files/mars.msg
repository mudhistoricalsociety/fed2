            %s walks in the wrong direction and stumbles against one of the walls. The lines and whorls suddenly flare up, dazzling you for a moment, and when the glare reduces and you can see again, there is a new dead, dry image added to the collection in the room...

            With no warning, part of the ledge crumbles beneath you. Desperately you clutch at the rock face, but there are no hand holds at this point. The fall to the bottom of the pit only takes a handful of seconds, but to you the time seems like an eternity...

            A comforting smell of home cooking approaches as a waitdroid brings you a plate of cottage pie, brimming full of beef topped with potatoes. The droid slams the plate onto the table and hurriedly departs. You eat the meal just as hurriedly, enjoying the flavor and the nourishment.

            You grab one of the ice cream baskets and start to lick at the frozen delicacy. It is... actually, you have no idea what it is, but it is revolting!

            You hear a crackling sound, and the sky is suddenly lit up with green flashes. Forks of emerald lightning arc across the sky, as if the universe was about to split apart. Could it be the end of the universe as we know it?
         </para>
         <para number='3' comment=''>
            The lightning flashes come faster and faster, and the forks get closer and closer together, until the whole sky shines with a continuous green light. The illumination pulses slightly, getting brighter then dimmer again, brigher... dimmer... it&apos;s almost hypnotic.
         </para>
         <para number='4' comment=''>
            Around you, people gasp and murmer in wonder, not sure whether to be afraid or to just enjoy the amazing light show.
         </para>
         <para number='5' comment='Scene 2`'>
            A small black dot appears almost directly overhead. It looks as though the green light is a solid dome, and the black dot a tiny hole in it. The hole widens slightly, and you realize that whatever the black dot is, it is getting larger.
         </para>
         <para number='6' comment=''>
            It suddenly becomes apparent what you are seeing, as your brain processes the visual information and translates the optical illusion into reality: it is an object that is getting closer, falling down towards Mars city. The crackling sound has stopped now, but a very faint noise replaces it - the sound of something screaming towards the planet.
         </para>
         <para number='7' comment='Scene 3'>
            The noise gets louder and resolves into something familiar - it&apos;s an engine. Someone in the crowd gasps and says, &quot;It&apos;s a spaceship!&quot; Of course it is, and it&apos;s coming in to land at very high speed. But it&apos;s no type you have ever seen before. Triangular in shape, it&apos;s completely black, with no markings at all.
         </para>
         <para number='8' comment=''>
            It falls further towards the city, and you expect it to start to veer off towards the spaceport, but it doesn&apos;t - it still seems to be heading straight for you. Surely that is just an illusion?
         </para>
         <para number='9' comment='Scene 4'>
            The strange black ship continues to hurtle downwards, and it looks as if it really is going to land right here on the roof. It is getting very close now, so that it practically fills your field of vision, blotting out the sky so you cannot see if the green lights are still flashing or not.
         </para>
         <para number='10' comment=''>
            With a whine of motors and rush of wind, the unknown vessel suddenly comes to a dead stop in the air above your head. It hovers about twenty feet off the ground, directly over the Chez Diesel building. You wait, along with everyone else on the roof, to see what happens next.
         </para>
         <para number='11' comment='Scene 5'>
            What happens next is that with a rumbling noise, a crack appears in the bottom of the ship, from which spills that familiar green light. The gap widens and a long, thin object protrudes. You can hear a hooting noise from within the ship - then suddenly, the object spouts a beam of light which connects with one of the waitdroids and blows its head clean off!
         </para>
         <para number='12' comment=''>
            Someone in the crowd suddenly exclaims, &quot;Oh my god - I know what that is. It&apos;s a Martian heat ray. I remember seeing it in Horsell, many years ago. It&apos;s the Martians - they&apos;ve come back!&quot; Screams and sounds of panicgreet this announcement.
         </para>
         <para number='13' comment='Scene 6'>
            The heat ray spits again, and another waitdroid&apos;s head is vaporized, then another. The few remaining shove you, along with the other party-goers, to one edge of the roof, shielded between the bouncy castle and some huge exotic pot plants. Good, faithful droids, they are trying to protect Diesel&apos;s customers from harm, as they have been programmed to do.
         </para>
         <para number='14' comment='Scene 7'>
            The heat ray fires once more, but this time it doesn&apos;t hit anyone - or anything. Then there is a sizzling noise, and sparks come from the end of the mechanism, and it drops off and lands with a &quot;clang&quot; on the roof. It seems to have malfunctioned rather badly!
         </para>
         <para number='15' comment=''>
            There is a sudden hooted exclamation from inside the ship - it sounds like the Martian equivalent of &quot;Oh bugger!&quot;
         </para>
         <para number='16' comment='Scene 8'>
            After a moment, more hooting can be heard from within the ship, along with some hammering noises. They stop, then start up again, until the hammering is quite frenzied. The hooting begins to sound desperate, but then you hear some motors start to work, and the hooting takes on a triumphant tone. A ramp protrudes from the opening underneath the ship, and reaches down towards the roof.
         </para>
         <para number='17' comment=''>
            About half way there, it judders to a halt. There is more hammering and hooting, and the ramp moves a bit more then stops, moves and then stops, then with a horrendous graunching noise it finally completes its extension and touches the roof.
         </para>
         <para number='18' comment='Scene 9'>
            A figure appears at the top of the ramp. For a moment, you can&apos;t make out what it looks like - it&apos;s just a silhouette against the green light. Then someone in the crowd exclaims, &quot;It&apos;s a Martian!&quot; No real surprise, given that someone had already identified the heat ray, but it is still a shock to see our old enemy return.
         </para>
         <para number='19' comment='Scene 10'>
            The Martian starts to move down the ramp, and another follows it. Now you can make out the details. What you are seeing is not the actual Martians themselves, but two of their three-legged fighting machines.
         </para>
         <para number='20' comment=''>
            Except... all the old stories you have read talk about the fighting machines being enormous, but these are barely four-foot tall. Could the machines contain dwarf Martians? Or perhaps immature ones, youngsters?
         </para>
         <para number='21' comment='Scene 11'>
            The two Martian machines reach the foot of the ramp and step onto the roof. Their movements seem slightly uncertain, as if the machines are not very good at walking on their three legs. The sensors at the top of the machines swivel back and forth, taking in their surroundings.
         </para>
         <para number='22' comment='Scene 12'>
            Some peremptory hooting comes from within one of the machines. You don&apos;t understand the language, so you have no idea what the creature is saying, but it sounds like a demand. Probably not &quot;Take me to your leader!&quot;
         </para>
         <para number='23' comment=''>
            Hardly anybody speaks Martian these days, but with an amazing stroke of luck, the waitdroid wearing the jesters cap - the one serving the fizzy drinks - pipes up and says, &quot;I did a correspondence course on alien languages, so I can speak a bit of Martian. I can try to understand what it is saying.&quot;
         </para>
         <para number='24' comment='Scene 13'>
            The Martians hoots some more, the waitdroid listens carefully, then attempts to translate. &quot;Where is the artichoke. No, that can&apos;t be right...&quot; It listens some more and tries again. &quot;Where is the... weasel? No... oh, I get it, the temple. It is asking where the temple is. It&apos;s calling us puny earthlings - goodness, should I be insulted by that? I am not puny, and I have never set foot on Earth.&quot;
         </para>
         <para number='25' comment='Scene 14'>
            There is some more hooting, and the droid says, &quot;This is very odd. It seems to think it has landed in the middle of the ruins, and it is demanding to know why we have built Chez Diesel in the religious center of its ancient home.&quot;
         </para>
         <para number='26' comment='Scene 15'>
            The waitdroid clears its throat and attempts to hoot back to the Martians in their language. After a few attempts, it seems to make itself understood, and a halting conversation ensues. Suddenly, the waitdroid laughs so hard it almost chokes, and has to take a drink of fizzy soda to recover. &quot;Mmmm, cherry,&quot; it says. &quot;My favorite.&quot; This does seem somewhat irrelevant considering the danger!
         </para>
         <para number='27' comment='Scene 16'>
            &quot;Oh, this is too funny,&quot; the droid exclaims. &quot;It was aiming for the ruins, but obviously its guidance systems malfunctioned. Apparently, the Martians have been stuck out on the galactic rim for so long with so few resources that everything is starting to break down. These guys volunteered for a mission to sneak back to the ruins and see if there was any usable equipment they could salvage.&quot;
         </para>
         <para number='28' comment='Scene 17'>
            The hooting from inside the Martian fighting machines becomes strident, and the waitdroid turns back to listen carefully, then translates. &quot;I don&apos;t think they like to be laughed at. No sense of humor, apparently. They picked the wrong day to land here, then!&quot; He jingles the bells on his jesters cap to emphasise that today is not a day to be serious.

            The droid hoots at the Martians and they hoot at him. It looks puzzled, then explains, &quot;I asked them why they shot up the other waitdroids, before their heat ray went on the fritz. They didn&apos;t understand my question - they think us waitdroids are battlebots.&quot; The droid looks faintly insulted at the misidentification.

            &quot;They planned to dispose of us using the heat ray from within the safety of their ship, then come out and deal with you organic types, who they don&apos;t rate as so much of a threat. It&apos;s probably just as well their weapon broke down, or we would all be toast by now.&quot;

            There is some more hooting back and forth. &quot;Oh dear,&quot; says the droid. &quot;They are getting impatient. They want us to produce their stolen... heritage? heirlooms? I&apos;m not sure what that word means. Relics, perhaps... They are talking about something called a vandier, and something else called a sargeur. I don&apos;t know what those things are.&quot;

            Suddenly, the Martians seem to lose patience, and one of the fighting machines strides across the roof and knocks the translating waitdroid to the ground. The other marches towards the trapdoor, obviously intending to descend into the bar. You hope Diesel is ready with her baseball bat!

         <para number='34' comment='Scene 21'>
            At this point, the Martians notice the party-goers cowering between the bouncy castle and the plants, and after conferring with each other in a muted hooting, they change direction and advance towards you and the others menacingly. The sensors on the top of the first Martian fighting machine zoom in on your position, and the alien gets closer and closer to you...

            Suddenly, one of the tripod&apos;s legs steps onto a container of ice cream that was dropped by Jen - or possibly Berry - when their heads exploded. The fighting machine lurches as the foot slips sideways, and drops of the ice cream splatter in all directions. Some lands on you; you lick it off - mmmm, chocolate heaven, almost enough to take your mind off your impending death!

            The Martian falls and knocks into its colleague, who also topples, and the two fighting machines accidentally stumble onto the bouncy castle. They bounce... bounce... bounce... getting more wildly uncoordinated with each ascension, and then suddenly they caroom off each other, off the side walls, off the bouncy castle and towards the edge of the roof.
         </para>
         <para number='37' comment='Scene 24'>
            Just as the fighting machines are about to be catapulted right over the edge of the force field, they crack open and the actual Martians tumble out and land in a heap on the table which holds the fizzy soda. The aliens look something like octopuses; slimy blobs with a lot of unpleasant tentacles. They write around on the table, attempting to get their tentacles pointing downwards so they can control their movements.
         </para>
         <para number='38' comment='Scene 25'>
            The table collapses and the aliens roll off, hooting in distress. The brightly-colored beverages start to spill from their containers and drip onto the Martians.

         <para number='39' comment=''>
            They don&apos;t seem too disturbed by the cherry flavor or the lemon; the tangerine and the peppermint have no effect, apart from making the slimy aliens look like an explosion in a paint factory, not to mention getting them all sticky; but then a container of Diesel&apos;s Old Peculiar splits open and disgorges its contents all over the creatures, and some of it drips into what passes for their mouths. They swallow it down...
         </para>
         <para number='40' comment='Scene 26'>
            The aliens go rigid for a moment, their tentacles sticking out stiffly in all directions. With a high-pitched hoot of distress, they collapse, completely limp, either dead or unconscious. Well, you always knew Diesel&apos;s Old Peculiar was potent stuff, but usually it takes more than a few drops to make drinkers pass out!

            As you wonder whether it&apos;s safe to come out, you hear the chunter of engines, and looking over the side of the roof you see several Imperial Navy stinger-ships zooming down from the sky. They take up station around the Martian ship, which is still hovering above the roof garden.

         <para number='42' comment='Scene 28'>
            A squad of Imperial Marines in full combat gear jumps from the ships&apos; hatches and lands on the roof. The troops swiftly gather up the bodies of the Martians and the collapsed fighting machines and jump back up to the ships. Then a special naval cleaning droid is lowered down to the roof; it hoovers up the spilt ice cream and puddles of fizzy soda, and generally cleans up the mess, leaving the roof garden tidier than it has been for years!

            A Marine mechanic activates replacements for the blown up waitdroids, including the two ice cream droids. Jen and Berry Mk II bustle around calling for replacement ice cream and drinks to be sent up from the kitchen. The droid who had been acting as a translator picks itself up from the corner into which it had been flung, repositions its jesters cap on its head, and prepares to serve fizzy soda again.
         </para>
         <para number='44' comment='Scene 30'>
            Finally, the Marine that seems to be in charge salutes you and the others left on the roof. &quot;Right, that&apos;s all sorted,&quot; he says in a brisk voice. &quot;Now it would be a very good idea if you just forgot that anything happened here. In fact, I would caution you against ever mentioning these events to anyone at all, and especially not to the press, not if you know what&apos;s good for you.&quot;

            After issuing this ominous but cryptic threat, he jumps back up to his stinger-ship.

            You order up a round of free drinks. A skeletal waitdroid hands you a silver goblet that contains a steaming, bright red liquid. It tells you that it&apos;s a cocktail called a Bucket of Blood, and promises you that it contains real blood - then gives a cackle and walks away. You don&apos;t want to appear squeamish, so you gulp down the bloody drink. It&apos;s hot and spicy and tastes great.

When you turn and look, you find it has gone - there is no longer a doorway there, just a wall. You can&apos;t get out that way; you will have to proceed into the haunted house and hope there&apos;s an exit somewhere else. Otherwise, you could be trapped here forever...

            The spider charm has been delicately carved from silver, with its little legs fashioned from fine silver wire, and two small pieces of amber for eyes, which flash in a way that is halfway between cute and scary. Squeeze it and it will become even scarier, and a lot less cute!

            You give the spider a squeeze, and it comes to life.

            This is inconvenient, to say the least, but before you can do something to stop the spider spinning any more web, you find that your arms (or equivalent) have been pinned to your sides by more web, and your legs immobilized.

            A Christmas microsynth that %s is carrying lights up and starts to play &quot;The Twelve Days of Christmas&quot;. The music is lovely, and the voices ring out with an exquisite five-part harmony.
         </para>
         <para number='4' comment='everyone'>
            To accompany the music, the synth produces a miniature model appropriate for each verse.
         </para>
         <para number='5' comment='roomex'>
            The first verse produces a tiny pear tree containing a partridge, which makes a loud &quot;Kerrr-ick&quot; noise.
         </para>
         <para number='6' comment=''>
            As the second verse plays, two turtle doves fly out of the synth. They flap around for a moment then come to rest on the top of the pear tree. Fortunately, although the song then sings about the partridge and the pear tree again, the synth has been programmed not to treat the models cumulatively. Just as well, otherwise you&apos;d end up with a whole lot of models!
         </para>
         <para number='7' comment=''>
            During the third verse, out pop three French hens. They squawk loudly then settle at the foot of the tree. One of them lays an egg.
         </para>
         <para number='8' comment=''>
            Four calling birds appear to go with the fourth verse. They try to land in the tree but the turtle doves peck at them and drive them off, so they just fly around the room, making a noise.
         </para>
         <para number='9' comment=''>
            For the fifth verse, there is respite from the parade of birds as the synth produces five gold rings, and hangs them onto the tree&apos;s branches. The partridge pecks at the rings and tries to eat them before deciding they are not bird food.
         </para>
         <para number='10' comment=''>
            And now we&apos;re back to the birds for the sixth verse. Six geese waddle out of the synth, making a hell of a noise. They proceed to lay their large eggs all over the floor. One of the eggs rolls against the trunk of the pear tree and smashes. What a mess!
         </para>
         <para number='11' comment=''>
            The seventh verse, and we get even more birds. Seven of them. Massive great swans. Complete with a wave of water so they can swim. At least the water washes away the egg debris!
         </para>
         <para number='12' comment=''>
            What a relief: no more birds. We&apos;re onto tiny models of people now. Here come eight maids. Oh dear, they are milking cows... and one of the cows kicks over a bucket of milk which spreads everywhere. Then another cow produces something other than milk from its back end... phew, what a smell!

            Verse nine. It&apos;s dancing ladies. At last, something that doesn&apos;t make a noise, or a mess. The ladies prance around the room very gracefully, fluttering fans, alternately opening them and hiding their faces, then closing them with a flick of their wrists. It&apos;s all very artistic.
         </para>
         <para number='14' comment=''>
            Hot on their heels come the ten lords, leaping out of the synth almost before their verse begins. They are keen! They jump around, barging into the ladies and disrupting their dance. The ladies start to hit the lords with their fans. The lords pull twigs off the pear tree to defend themselves. The lords and ladies start mock-fencing. Mayhem ensues.
         </para>
         <para number='15' comment=''>
            With a deafening racket, eleven kilted pipers show up, playing the bagpipes. It sounds like many cats are being strangled, and it almost drowns out the sound of the song that the synth is playing. The terrible din does have the advantage of subduing the bickering lords and ladies somewhat.
         </para>
         <para number='16' comment=''>
            Finally, we reach the last verse, but this means even more noise as twelve drummers burst out of the synth, bashing away at their drums as loudly as they can. They march around the room - it&apos;s getting very crowded now! One drummer bumps into a piper and knocks him over. The piper lands on his behind with his legs in the air, and you get a very good view of just what he wears under his kilt.
         </para>
         <para number='17' comment=''>
            Enraged by this, the rest of the pipers start attacking the drummers, and a wholesale fight ensues. The tiny lords and ladies scream and run to avoid getting caught up in the barney, but they slip in the mess left by the cows, geese and birds and tumble to the ground. The birds take flight and squawk loudly as they flap around the room in fright.
         </para>
         <para number='18' comment=''>
            The miniature pipers and drummers whale on each other with their instruments: several of the pipers now have drums over their heads, and one has a drumstick stuck up his nose. A piper is attempting to suffocate a drummer with the bag of his pipe.

            Before any more serious injuries can be inflicted, a siren sounds and a squad of policedroids screech up. Luckily the synth comes to the end of its program and it sucks all the models back inside to be reused next time, and the robocobs are unable to tell that you started all this chaos. They vanish and leave a solitary garbage droid to clean up the terrible mess.

            A lump of rock descends at great speed and lands right on top of the barbecue! With a *BANG* it explodes, charring the cooking meat to a cinder and threatening to set light to everything and everybody on the roof. Fortunately, the waitdroid hurls itself across the grill and smothers the flames with its body. Once the conflagration has died down, it brushes itself off and replaces the ruined burgers and steaks with fresh meat.

            The stardust is safely housed in a small glass vial with an ornate silver stopper which has been firmly soldered into place. The only way to get the dust out now would be to break it. As you look at the glittering dust, its flickering is quite intriguing. Perhaps you might learn something if you were to contemplate it... or maybe by shaking it its movement might impart some meaning. Failing that, you could display it so others can see it.

            The cat is suddenly distracted by a small leaf which falls from the tree. He pounces on it and proceeds to kill it thoroughly, since it is clearly very dangerous and threatening. When it is completely destroyed, he looks up at you proudly, reassuring you that you are safe now.

            The cat avoids your reaching hand and springs up to land halfway up the tree. He proceeds to climb his way up to the top, where he sits on a branch, king of all he surveys. After a few moments, he decides to come back down: he leans forward from the branch until he is almost hanging upside down from it, and then jumps back to the ground.

            You stroke the cat&apos;s soft fur, but he is distracted by a rustling noise coming from one side of the square. A marsrat pokes its nose out of a hole and then scurries across the open space.

            When the cat judges that the moment has arrived, he pounces, trying to pin the marsrat down with his paws. But the little rat manages to evade the striking cat, and rushes off again.

            She laughs a big, booming laugh which makes the glasses on the tables rattle. &quot;Oh come on,&quot; she says, &quot;everyone&apos;s heard of me. I&apos;m the most famous bar-owner ever. I&apos;ve been running this bar since the early days of the colony on Mars.

         <para number='5' comment='bar/social center/chez diesel'>
            &quot;Chez Diesel is my pride and joy,&quot; Diesel says, with a misty look in her eyes. &quot;Way back when Mars colony was just a rough collection of habitats, I opened the bar to cater for the spacers who came visiting. It was a rough place then, to quote the song, just a noisy hall where there&apos;s a nightly brawl. And boy, what brawls we had!
         </para>
         <para number='6' comment=''>
            &quot;I had to replace the furniture every couple of weeks, because the drinkers were always hitting each other over the head with chairs and tables when they started to fight, but that was just part of the cost of doing business. They were cheap plastic chairs of course. My baseball bat saw a lot of use back then, and many a space helmet had a bat-shaped dent in it.&quot; She picks up the bat and strokes it lovingly for a moment.
         </para>
         <para number='7' comment=''>
            &quot;Then Mars became the booming settlement it is today,&quot; Diesel continues, &quot;the colony expanded, and my clientele changed - we really went upmarket. I had to redecorate the place, installed the fountain, hired a pianist and so on. I make a helluva lot more money now, but sometimes I miss the fun of those early, hell-raising days.&quot; She sighs nostalgically and places the bat back on the bar.

         <para number='8' comment='Mars'>
            &quot;I wasn&apos;t quite one of the founding fathers,&quot; she says - then pauses to think for a moment. &quot;Do I mean founding mothers? No, that sounds terrible - like a female overlord being an overlady. Or that confusion when the leader of the Traders Guide was a woman, and someone proposed her title should be Guild Mistress - she wasn&apos;t amused! Gender-specific words can be strange sometimes...&quot;
         </para>
         <para number='9' comment=''>
            She shakes herself out of her reverie. &quot;Where was I? Oh yes, the founding of Mars. I wasn&apos;t in the first wave of colonists, but once the colony was established enough to need somewhere people could relax and have a drink, I saw the opportunity and set up the bar here. Mars was a very rough place in those days, with none of the facilities it has now.
         </para>
         <para number='10' comment=''>
            &quot;Mars was the first real colony to be set up. Well, the moon had people living on it long before that, but they didn&apos;t become an independent colony until after we did.

         <para number='11' comment=''>
            &quot;So, planetologists loved the idea of living on Mars, so they could study the place; mining companies and independent prospectors thought they might find rare minerals here; and of course the archeologists were gasping for joy at the chance to explore the ruins. I think they were hoping to find some real live Martians.&quot;
         </para>
         <para number='12' comment='Earth'>
            &quot;I don&apos;t miss Earth at all,&quot; she tells you. &quot;For one thing, I love the low gravity here. Makes moving about a lot easier.&quot; She laughs, a huge belly laugh, and eyeing her considerable bulk you can see why she prefers Mars&apos; low gravity.
         </para>
         <para number='13' comment=''>
            &quot;And I hated the crowds. And the rules and regulations - seemed like you needed a permit to breathe or to take a piss.

         </para>
         <para number='14' comment='Martians'>
            Diesel frowns. &quot;I know the archeologists were hoping they would find Martians still living somewhere deep in the ruins, but thank Pegasus they turned out to be long gone. Still, I remember the problems they caused in the past, trying to get back through to this time, or this dimension, or whatever the official term is. They were a real menace. And of course their meddling with time finally brought interstellar commerce crashing down.
         </para>
         <para number='15' comment=''>
            &quot;There are some people who blame every little thing that happens on the Martians. Oh, I tripped over the cat - it&apos;s the Martians&apos; fault. My spaceship broke down - must be the Martians&apos; fault. Idiots.&quot; She looks scornful.

         <para number='16' comment=''>
            &quot;At the other extreme, of course, are those fools in the Alien Protection League, who deny that the Martians ever tried to invade Earth. They think the Martians are cuddly benign creatures who have been misunderstood. Morons!&quot;

         <para number='17' comment='alien protection league/aliens'>
            &quot;Don&apos;t get me wrong,&quot; explains Diesel, &quot;I believe aliens are people too and deserve just the same rights as humans. I&apos;ve always welcomed them in the bar, so long as they have groats. But I don&apos;t go along with those woolly-minded bleeding hearts who seem to think aliens are some kind of saints who can do no wrong. I&apos;ve known some aliens who were just as unpleasant and untrustworthy as humans can be.

         <para number='19' comment='ruins'>
            &quot;Oh, I remember the excitement when the ruins were first discovered,&quot; Diesel says, reminiscing. &quot;The first evidence that Mars had once housed not just life, but intelligent life. Of course, this was before interstellar travel so humanity had never met any aliens before. Scientists spent years trying to figure out all the machines in the ruins.
         </para>
         <para number='20' comment=''>
            &quot;Kids used to dare each other to go into the ruins and explore. It was dangerous, and there were a lot of accidents, but parents weren&apos;t so protective then. I don&apos;t recall anyone actually dying - not permanently, anyway, cos all the kids were fixed up with insurance.
         </para>
         <para number='21' comment=''>
            &quot;Then came the discovery that the power system in the ruins could be started up to provide a route through to the pirate asteroid. Trouble was, wannabe heroes kept doing it wrong and blowing up the equipment. Used to shake the bar from foundation to rafters sometimes.
         </para>
         <para number='22' comment=''>
            &quot;I was relieved when the Snark pirates were finally dealt with once and for all, and the Galactic Administration took away some of the critical bits needed to fire up the power system. Peace and quiet descended on Mars again, thank Pegasus!&quot;
         </para>
         <para number='23' comment='drinks/ale/beer/old peculia'>
            &quot;I am very proud of my ale,&quot; Diesel tells you. &quot;It was not long after I opened the bar, when there was a problem with getting enough beer shipped from Earth. I discovered the waitdroids had a brewing program installed along with their instructions, so I put them to work to try and come up with an ale we could sell.
         </para>
         <para number='24' comment=''>
            &quot;The first attempts were disgusting, but eventually, after loads of experimenting, we hit on the right recipe, and Diesel&apos;s Old Peculiar was born. Guaranteed to put hairs on your chest. Or burn them off. Or something.&quot;
         </para>
         <para number='25' comment='recipe'>
            &quot;Do you take me for a fool?&quot; Diesel asks scornfully. &quot;The recipe for Diesel&apos;s Old Peculiar is a secret. And there&apos;s no point badgering the waitdroids, they are programmed never to tell.&quot;

         <para number='26' comment='pizza/moose/food'>
            She sighs. &quot;The whole moose pizza thing has got way out of hand, you know. It started out when these muck-raking journalists wrote up a scurrilous article claiming to have found a moose in the fridge. They said I put it on the pizzas. Ridiculous. Where would I have got hold of a moose? They don&apos;t exactly run wild on the Martian plains...&quot;
         </para>
         <para number='27' comment=''>
            &quot;Anyway, my customers thought it was a huge joke, and they kept on asking for extra moose on their pizzas. In the end I gave in just to shut them up - I found a company on Earth that exported freeze-dried meat of various kinds, and put in an order for some ground moose. And whatdya know, it was a huge hit, and now it&apos;s my house pizza.&quot;

            &quot;He was a mad bastard, wasn&apos;t he?&quot; she says. &quot;Life was precarious when he was in charge. You never knew what crackpot law he was going to pass next: I remember when he outlawed beards, then he passed an ordinance renaming Tuesday after his mother.

         <para number='29' comment=''>
            &quot;Of course, nobody actually enforced the laws, except for in his presence, so most of his madness was just ignored by the ordinary people. So long as you didn&apos;t come to his attention you were probably alright.

            You start to pick Diesel&apos;s baseball bat up from the bar, but with lightning-quick reflexes she grabs it before you can. She raps your knuckles with it, leaving them bruised and painful, thus discouraging you from trying to take what doesn&apos;t belong to you.

            &quot;I know my waitdroids are only dumb robots,&quot; says Diesel, &quot;with hardly any artificial intelligence capabilities, but I like them.

            Diesel frowns. &quot;Some people think the idea of pirates is romantic - they think of the old fashioned pirates of the sea, yohoho and a bottle of rum and all that. Actually I expect that&apos;s just nostalgic twaddle anyway, and those old pirates were pretty unpleasant folks themselves!

            &quot;Pirates these days are not in the least bit romantic. Now I&apos;m not the most law-abiding citizen, and I certainly wish the Galactic Administration would stop trying to regulate my life, but I draw the line at violent crime - and that&apos;s what piracy is. Blowing up other people&apos;s ships and killing them in order to steal their stuff is not romantic, it&apos;s bad. The ones based on the Snark asteroid were the worst.

            The forklift makes several journeys to the storage bin, and brings over four carbon atoms and two nitrogen atoms, which it lays out carefully in a hexagon shape.

            Returning to the bins, the forklift brings out two nitrogen atoms and another carbon atom. The nitros are attached to two of the set of three carbon atoms on the hexagon. The carbon atom is placed between the other ends of the nitrogen atoms, and the configuration bonds into a pentagon. So, we now have a pentagon and a hexagon attached by a common side.

         <para number='8' comment=''>
            Back to the storage bins, and this time the forklift is carrying a carbon atom with three attached hydrogen atoms. As you watch, these are bonded to one of the nitros in the pentagon. The process is then repeated attaching the new CH3 molecule to one of the nitrogens on the hexagon.
         </para>

            There is a hissing noise as the rocket&apos;s fuse ignites, and then it shoots up into the air with a whoosh, trailing sparks behind it. There&apos;s a pause... and then it detonates with a loud *BANG* and releases its sparkles in concentric rings of different colors, one after the other, which widen to fill the sky and then vanish.

            There is a hissing noise as the rocket&apos;s fuse ignites, and then it shoots up into the air with a whoosh, trailing sparks behind it. The trail vanishes, and for a moment nothing happens - you wonder if it was a dud. Then a burst of light appears, followed a second later by a popping noise, as the light resolves into a silver weeping willow shape. The sky is filled with bright lights which twinkle frantically before fading into nothing.

            There is a hissing noise as the rocket&apos;s fuse ignites, and then it shoots up into the air with a whoosh, trailing sparks behind it. There&apos;s a pause... and then it detonates with a loud *BANG* and releases a host of small purple lights, which themselves explode a few seconds later, releasing smaller lights which dart off in different directions before releasing their own cargo of tiny purple sparks.

            The sky is soon filled with purple lights darting off in all different directions. It&apos;s hard to know where to look. Then the sparks fade out, one by one, until the sky is clear once again.

            There is a hissing noise as the rocket&apos;s fuse ignites, and then it shoots off - but not up into the air as it is supposed to, but straight towards the forcefield! You watch in horror as it heads for the glowing barrier, on course to cause a very nasty conflagration.

            At the last minute, a waitdroid spots the looming firework and flings itself into its path, intercepting it before it can strike its target. It flings itself onto the ground on top of the wayward rocket, shielding you - and anyone else who happens to be on the roof - from the resulting explosion. It stands up, showing a huge dent in its body-casing, and staggers off to get repaired.

         <para number='10' comment='Light roman candle 1'>
            The firework hisses, and then shoots jets of sparks high into the air. The candle starts to rotate, sending the fire in different directions, surrounding the roof garden with a golden curtain of sparks heading skywards, like a waterfall in reverse. Finally, it dies down and the remains crumble to dust and blow away.

            The firework hisses, and then shoots a large ball of green flame into the air, then another, and another. They rise up high into the sky before slowing... slowing... slowing... and then falling back towards the surface. You feel a thrill of anticipation as it looks as if one might land on the roof garden, but they all fizzle out just before touching down.

            With a screech, the mortar hurls itself into the sky, where it explodes with a thunderous noise and a bright flash. The whole sky lights up with a dazzling white light, and the noise of the explosion sends shockwaves through the thin Martian air that you can feel from the roof garden. As the light and sound fades away, you feel quite shell-shocked!

            The mirror is an odd neutral color, which shows your reflection in a sort of grainy monochrome. It&apos;s about one and a half times your height, and twice your width.
         </para>
         <para number='2' comment='examine mirror II'>
            The frame is matte black, with dull red lines and whorls similar to those on the walls. These, however, do not shine with their own light, they are merely visible in the reflected light from the walls. You trace one of the lines with the tip of a finger (or the equivalent), and feel a tingling sensation.
         </para>
         <para number='3' comment='examine mirror III'>
            Walking round the mirror you discover that it seems to have no depth and that the back is completely matte black, but solid to the touch. You push hard, but are unable to move it in the slightest.
         </para>
         <para number='4' comment='examine mirror IV'>
            Returning to the front, you place your hand on the mirror surface. It seems warm and yielding to the touch. Ripples spread out from the point of contact, are reflected from the sides and interfere to produce weird, undulating patterns on the surface.
         </para>
         <para number='5' comment='examine mirror V'>
            Feeling slightly queasy, you step back a few paces, pick up a stone and cast it at the mirror. As it hits the mirror it is absorbed without a trace, not even a ripple, and the surface returns to its original smooth neutral color.
         </para>

            You push against the elastic texture of the mirror&apos;s surface. The resistance suddenly vanishes and you tumble into a void. Gradually you become aware of a dim greenish glow which draws your attention to the fact that you seem to be surrounded by a semi-translucent energy field...
         </para>
         <para number='8' comment='enter (1st time) ||'>
            You get the impression that the bubble containing you is moving, but it is difficult to be sure. More importantly, as your eyes adjust you become aware of the fact that several patches of the energy field appear to be wavering and are starting to grow dimmer...
         </para>
         <para number='9' comment='enter (1st time) III'>
            Suddenly the bubble is shaken violently, as though something has seized it. There is a feeling of rapid acceleration, followed by equally violent deceleration. The energy field collapses in a shower of colored sparks and you find yourself perched on a block of shimmering silver material.

            &quot;Yes there was a nasty accident. I was testing these new fangled teleporters when transmission was distorted by emanations from the functioning machines in the ruins. My smile materialised here, but not the rest of me.

            &quot;Well, based on my observations while I&apos;ve been here, I think the lines are a trap to catch the unwary. If you touch them they suck out your life force, until all that&apos;s left is an insubstantial image.

            &quot;What&apos;s not clear is why they are here. My best guess is that they are here to protect something - possibly the mirror, or maybe that suspicious looking slab of iron in the next room. I tend to go for the mirror theory, myself.&quot;

         <para number='9' comment='mirror I'>
            &quot;The mirror is some sort of advanced teleporter portal. I suspect that it was the energy released when it materialised in the ruins that caused the accident.

            &quot;I&apos;ve no idea where the other end of the portal is, only that few who have ventured through it have ever returned. And none of the returnees would discuss it with me. Come to think of it, though, a lot of them seem to have joined the Cult of Gaelaan.&quot;

            &quot;The ruins are all that remains of the widespread Martian civilisation. When tectonic activity stopped, Mars lost its protective magnetic field, and over the eons, the solar wind stripped it of its atmosphere.

            &quot;The mirror and the lines combine to form a power nexus. The ruins themselves are &apos;live&apos; in the sense that all the components have access to power and facilities for using it. Although the power is distributed there are a few places, like this one, which can serve as a focus for the power.

            &quot;There have been suggestions that the power in the ruins is just the residue from when the Martians left, but I&apos;m not so sure.

            Diesel is giving customers free meals this Christmas. A waitdroid places a plate before you, containing a traditional Christmas dinner: slices of roast goose with all the trimmings. You eat that, and then get served a miniature Christmas pudding, with a sprig of holly on the top. The waitdroid pours brandy over it and then ignites it; it burns with a blue flame for a few moments, and then you tuck in and finish it all up.

            The cake actually tastes pretty good; the combination of spices and very dark sugar is pleasing. But it has the solidity of a small boulder. You scrunch your way through, avoiding the bullet-like bits of fruit which are scattered through it and have the density of depleted uranium, and are left with an aching jaw and a solid lump in your belly (or wherever food goes for your particular anatomy).

            As you bite into it, you find something even solider than the cake itself. You spit it out and clean off the crumbs - it is a gold coin! It must be quite old because it has a picture of the ex-Emperor Ming on one side. The reserve shows the rear end of a grizzle as it vanishes into a cave. The coin isn&apos;t worth anything - it&apos;s no longer legal tender - but it&apos;s a nice souvenir.
