One of the oldest text based games, Federation has now released their source code!

Mud Historical Society thanks Bella and Hazed for all their amazing work over the years.  They are truly and inspiration for all others to come after them.  Their goodbye note can be read here: https://github.com/mudhistoricalsociety/fed2/blob/main/HISTORY

FED2 COMMUNITY VERSION
The Galaxy's exchanges await you in Fed2 Community!

Fed2 Community aims to keep the spirit of Alan Lenton’s Federation 2 alive, whilst modernizing the game’s foundation, improving security, and adding some neat new changes.

Fed2 Community is a new galaxy. We’re starting over, but we’re not starting from scratch — we invite all Federation 2 planet owners to jump to Founder or beyond in Fed2 Community! We will restore your star systems with planets, exchanges, and infrastructure intact and we’ll promote you to a rank appropriate for your system.

Fed2 Community is brought to you by Managers Cosmo, Preston, and Smitty, all former Federation 2 players.

Live the life of a Galactic trader in Federation DataSpace!
